- Update each turn to track progress/errors, 
add/update each turn accordingly — don't remove previous records or ladder steps. 
- "Recent turn: {n}" = previous turn; Each new branch; Next turn become current, then change [PENDING] to [DONE]. 
- If update on same branch, incrementally append "{turn}.{n}" (Eg. 1.1, 1.2).
- If current update can't bridge the gap and continue to next step; output in summary/readiness reports and suggest next fix on the same branch.

Recent turn: 4
Next turn: 5 [PENDING]

---

## Turn 1
- Implemented billing gateway facade with Play/Noop implementations and timeout-guarded provider integration.
- Known issues: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` fails because `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is missing from the repository.

1.1 (updates) 
- Re-reviewed billing gateway changes; no additional defects identified pending integration tests.
- Outstanding caution: Gradle wrapper JAR still absent, blocking `./gradlew` commands.

Known errors:
- Gradle wrapper missing (turn 1). 

---

## Turn 2
- Ensured billing initialization happens once via `DependencyProvider`, avoiding duplicate calls from `MainActivity` and caching the host activity safely.
- Pending action: Gradle wrapper JAR remains missing; build commands still unavailable.

Known errors:
- Gradle wrapper still missing (from turn 1). 

---

## Turn 3
- Gated payment surfaces on the billing gateway availability flag, added shared "billing unavailable" UI, and deferred upgrade injections when billing is disabled.
- Build remains blocked by missing Gradle wrapper JAR, so assemble/test tasks still cannot run.

Known errors:
- Gradle wrapper still missing (from turn 1). 

---

## Turn 4
- Hardened billing flows with `runCatching` wrappers around product queries, purchase launches, and acknowledgements, emitting debug-only diagnostics and keeping the gateway flagged unavailable on failure.
- Confirmed the shared "billing unavailable" messaging now drives purchase state updates instead of raw exception text.
- Known errors: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` (not run: Gradle wrapper JAR missing from repository).

---

## Turn 5
- Pending.

## Ladder Plan for a Play-optional Build

### Ladder Step 1 – Establish the billing abstraction boundary

Extract a BillingGateway interface plus concrete PlayBillingGateway and NoopBillingGateway, then introduce a BillingProvider that performs the timed initialization and hands back the correct implementation. This matches the repository guidelines for modular billing and lays the groundwork for all downstream changes.

**Suggested task**: 
Create billing gateway abstraction [DONE] 

### Ladder Step 2 – Replace direct GMS checks with the provider

Update BillingManagerWrapper (and any other callers) to request a BillingGateway from the provider and delete all GoogleApiAvailability/ConnectionResult usage. Treat the gateway’s available flag as the single source of truth for billing readiness.

**Suggested task**: 
Integrate BillingProvider into existing billing wrapper [DONE] 

### Ladder Step 3 – Gate UI and view-model logic on billing availability
Compose screens and the view model should read the gateway’s availability, hiding or disabling upgrade paths when billing is not ready, while continuing normal app functionality.

**Suggested task**: 
Update UI and state to respect billing availability [DONE] 

### Ladder Step 4 – Harden error handling and logging

Wrap billing calls in runCatching, downgrade logs to debug level, and guarantee the UI never surfaces stack traces—mapping every failure to a graceful disabled state.

**Suggested task**: 
Apply defensive error-handling to billing flows [PENDING] 

### Ladder Step 5 – Validate through builds and scenario testing
Run the Gradle build/test suite and execute the manual device matrix to ensure parity with and without Google Play services.

**Suggested task**: 
Run build, unit, lint, and manual billing matrix [PENDING]
