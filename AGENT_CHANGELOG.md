# Agent Changelog

## Turn 1
- Implemented billing gateway facade with Play/Noop implementations and timeout-guarded provider integration.
- Known issues: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` fails because `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is missing from the repository.

## Turn 2
- Re-reviewed billing gateway changes; no additional defects identified pending integration tests.
- Outstanding caution: Gradle wrapper JAR still absent, blocking `./gradlew` commands.

## Turn 3
- Ensured billing initialization happens once via `DependencyProvider`, avoiding duplicate calls from `MainActivity` and caching the host activity safely.
- Pending action: Gradle wrapper JAR remains missing; build commands still unavailable.

## Turn 4
- Gated payment surfaces on the billing gateway availability flag, added shared "billing unavailable" UI, and deferred upgrade injections when billing is disabled.
- Build remains blocked by missing Gradle wrapper JAR, so assemble/test tasks still cannot run.
