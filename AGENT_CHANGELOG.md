# Agent Changelog

## Turn 1
- Implemented billing gateway facade with Play/Noop implementations and timeout-guarded provider integration.
- Known issues: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` fails because `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is missing from the repository.

## Turn 2
- Re-reviewed billing gateway changes; no additional defects identified pending integration tests.
- Outstanding caution: Gradle wrapper JAR still absent, blocking `./gradlew` commands.
